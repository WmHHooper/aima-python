This CSP project is based off of the image shireMap.jpg, a much abstracted version of the map from
Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'. The names of the towns have been shortened down to their initials (full names
can be found here: http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/File:Map_-_Shire.jpg)

shireCSP fulfills the following requirements:
1.) the CSP runs without exceptions and generates valid coloring - +60
2.) the map cannot be colored in less than 4 colors - +10
3.) the map requires fewer assignments when select_unassigned_variable=csp.mrv - +10
4.) the map requires fewer assignments when order_domain_values=csp.lcv - +10
5.) the map requires fewer assignments when inference=csp.mac or csp.forward_checking - +10
6.) I pushed a 60-point solution by Tuesday, Oct. 9 before 6:00 am - +10
