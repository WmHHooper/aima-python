+10: The map requires fewer assignments when select_unassigned_variable=csp.mrv
-The map only returns 24 recursive calls, and 23 assignments for this heuristic.

+10: The map requires fewer assignments when order_domain_values=csp.lcv
-The map only returns 24 recursive calls, and 23 assignments for this heuristic.

+10: The map requires fewer assignments when inference=csp.mac or csp.forward_checking
