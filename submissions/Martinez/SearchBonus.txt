#65 points= I made a complex Germany map many interconnected cities.
# +10= with Bremen to munich I managed to make BFS better than DFS but not UCS better than BFS
##+10 = I decided to change the starting and goal points and successfully made, not only BFS much better than DFS, but also
#UCS better than BFS with a 10 points difference
total 85 points.
