Homework -- Due September 27, 2018

+10: Display method
+2 : all states correctly return the maximum number of actions, which is 2


Note: I gave Star29 an initial state, based off of FlagrentCopy.
    However, when I try to run the interactive version,
    I get the error: AttributeError: 'Star29' object has no attribute 'initial'
