ALL BONUSES APPLIED FOR


60: The CSP runs without exceptions*, and generates valid coloring.
    --> Both the original and modified maps succeed in this.
+10: The map cannot be colored in less than 4 colors.
    --> The modified map, instantiated as "modC2", cannot be colored in less than 4.
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when select_unassigned_variable=csp.mrv
    --> The original reduces the number of recursive calls, and both reduce the number of assignments tested.
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when order_domain_values=csp.lcv
    --> The original reduces the number of recursive calls, and both reduce the number of assignments tested.
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when inference=csp.mac or csp.forward_checking
    --> The original reduces the number of recursive calls, and both reduce the number of assignments tested.
+10: Push a 60-point solution by Tuesday, Oct. 9 before 6:00 am
    --> Did original submission Monday night
