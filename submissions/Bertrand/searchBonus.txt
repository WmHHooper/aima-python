From homework due Sept 13:
    65: All instances run without exceptions, and generate valid output for, all four searches.
    +10: An instance that yields a better solution with BFS than DFS
    +10: An instance that yields a better solution with UCS than BFS

All above criteria completed with "Wayne County" search




From homework due Sept 20:
    Adding coordinates to map:
        +10: All instances run without exceptions, and generate valid output for, BestFS and A*
        +10: An instance yields a better solution with BestFS than with arbitrary DFS --> "Wayne3"
        +10: An instance yields a better solution with BFS than BestFS --> "Wayne2" and "Wayne3"
        +10: An instance yields the same solution with UCS and A*, but expands fewer nodes with A* --> "Wayne2"
