The points I believe I have earned:

60: The CSP runs without exceptions, and generates valid coloring.
+10: The map cannot be colored in less than 4 colors.
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when select_unassigned_variable=csp.mrv
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when order_domain_values=csp.lcv
+10: The map requires fewer assignments when inference=csp.mac or csp.forward_checking
+10: Push a 60-point solution by Tuesday, Oct. 9 before 6:00 am
